Discussion
2. Give a truth table that shows the Boolean value of each of the following
Boolean expressions, for every possible combination of "input" values.
Hint: Including columns for intermediate expressions is helpful.

3. Write a while loop fragment that calculates the following values:
a) Sum of the first n counting numbers: 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + n
    sum = 0
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        sum = sum + i
        i += 1

b) Sum of the first n odd numbers: 1 + 3 + 5 + . . . + 2n - 1
    sum = 0
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        sum = sum + i
        i += 2

c) Sum of a series of numbers entered by the user until the value 999 is entered. Note: 999 should not be part of the sum.
    sum = 0
    i = 0
    i = input("Enter the amount (enter 999)")
    while i < 999:
        sum = sum + i
        i = input("Enter the amount (enter 999)")
    print(sum)

d) The number of times a whole number n can be divided by 2 (using
integer division) before reaching 1 (i.e., log2n) .
    n = input("Enter the number n to be divided: ")
    i = 2
    times = 0
    while ((n % i) == 0 ):
        i += 2
        times += 1
