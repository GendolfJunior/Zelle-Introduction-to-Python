### REVIEW QUESTIONS


## True/False

#  1. The median is the average of a set of data. FALSE
#     [Explanation: p.365: It is the "middle value" in a set of numbers listed in order.

#  2. Standard deviation measures how spread out a data set is. TRUE
#     [This definition is mostly true, except that it omits mention of mean (average).
#     Explanation: p.365: "The standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the data is relative
#     to the ean. If the data is tightly clustered around the mean, then the standard deviation is small.
#     When the data is more spread out, the stnadard deviation is larger. The standard deviation
#     provides a yardstick for determing how excpetional a value is."]

#  3. Arrays are usually heterogeneous, but lists are homogeneous. FALSE
#     [Explanation: Other way around.
#     p.367: "Arrays are also usually homogeneous. ... [Python lists] are "heterogeneous."]

#  4. A Python list cannot grow and shrink in size. FALSE
#     [Explanation: p.367: "In contrast, Python lists are dynamic. They can grow and shrink on demand."]

#  5. Unlike strings, Python lists are not mutable. FALSE
#     [Explanation: p.368: "Recall that one important difference between lists and strings is that lists are
#     mustable."]

#  6. A list must contain at least one item. FALSE
#     [Explanation: A list can start out empty, e.g if it is being used as an accumulator. See p.369.]

#  7. Items can be removed from a list with the del operator. TRUE
#     [Explanation: p.369: "Individual items or entire slices can be removed from a list using the del operator."]

#  8. A tuple is similar to an immutable list. TRUE
#     [Explanation: p.387: "A tuple is just another kind of sequence in Python. Tuples are like lists except that
#     tuples are immutable..."]

#  9. A Python dictionary is a kind of sequence. FALSE
#     [Explanation: p.401: "Python dictionaries are mappings [of key-value pairs]. Some other programming
#     langauges provide similar structures called hashes or associative arrrays."]
#     p.402: "When a dictionary is printed out, the order of keys will look essentially random. If you want
#     to keep a collection of items in a certain order, you need a sequence, not a mapping."]
