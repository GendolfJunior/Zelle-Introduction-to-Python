def refrain():
    print("Old MacDonald had a farm, Ee-igh, Ee-igh, Oh!")

def animal(kind, noise):
    refrain()
    print("And on that farm he had a " kind "Ee-igh, Ee-igh, Oh!")
    print("With a " noise", " noise " here and a " noise", " noise " there.")
    print("Here a " noise ", there a " noise ", everywhere a " noise ".")
    refrain()

def main:
    animal("pig", "oink")
    print()
    animal("duck", "quack")
    print()
    animal("sheep", "baah")
    print()
    animal("cow", "moo")
    print()
    animal("dog", "woof")

#  2. Write a program to print the lyrics for ten verses of "The Ants Go Marching." A couple of sample versus are given below.
#     You may choose your own activity for the "little one" in each verse, but be sure to choose something that makes the rhyme
#     work (or almost work).

#  3. Write definitions for these functions:
