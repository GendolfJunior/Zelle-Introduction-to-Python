### REVIEW QUESTIONS


## True/False

#  1. Object-oriented design is the process of finding and defining a useful set of functions for solving a problem. FALSE
#     [Note: Sounds more like a definition related to functional programming.
#     Explanation: p.420: "Object-oriented design is the process of finding and defining a useful set of classes for
#     a given problem."]

#  2. Candidate objects can be found by looking at the verbs in a problem description. FALSE
#     [Note: Going by intuition alone, objects should be based on nouns.
#     Explanation: p.420: "Your goal is to define a set of objects that will be helpful in solving the problem. Start with a
#     careful consideration of the problems statement. Objects are usually described as nouns."]

#  3. Typically, the design process involves considerable trial and error. TRUE
#     [Explanation: p.421: "Don't be afraid to scrap an approach that doesn't seem to be working or to follow an idea and see
#     where it leads. Good design involves a lot of trial and error."]

#  4. GUIs are often built with a model-view architecture. TRUE
#     [GUIs are concerned with the visible representation of a model, so yes.
#     Explanation: p.519: "model-view architecture: Dividing up a GUI program by separating the problem (model) from the user
#     interface (view)."]

#  5. Hiding the details of an object in a class definition is called instantiation. FALSE
#     [This is actually called encapsulation.
#     [Explanation: p.452: "The actual implementation of an object is independent of its use."
#     p.516: "encapsulation: Hiding the details of something. Usually this is the term used to describe the distinction
#     between the implementation and use of an object or function. Details are encapsulated in the definition."] 

#  6. Polymorphism literally means "many changes." FALSE
#     [Explanation: p.453: "Literally, the world polymorphism means 'many forms.'"]

#  7. A superclass inherits behaviors from its subclasses. FALSE
#     [Note: Again going by intuition here, inheritance works the other way.
#     Explanation: p.453: "The idea behind inheritance is that a new class can be defined to borrow behavior from another class.
#     The new class (the one doing the borrowing) is called a subclass, and the existing class (the one being borrowed from) is
#     its superclass."]

#  8. GUIs are generally easier to write than text-based interfaces. FALSE
#     [GUIs can be extremely complicated, hence my response.
#     Explanation: p.440: "Usually, graphical interfaces are much more complicated to design and build than text-based ones."]
